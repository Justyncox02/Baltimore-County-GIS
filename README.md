Baltimore County GIS Analysis

Overview

This GIS project visualizes key spatial data related to urban planning and economic development in Baltimore County, Maryland. Using QGIS, this map integrates multiple data layers to highlight vacant properties, shopping centers, transportation zones, and priority funding areas.

Features

Vacant Properties (Yellow Dots): Identifies properties that are currently unoccupied.

Shopping Centers (Blue Dots): Highlights major commercial retail hubs.

Commercial Revitalization Districts (Light Blue Areas): Zones targeted for economic redevelopment.

Basic Services & Transportation Zones (Red Boundaries): Areas demarcating key service and transit infrastructure.

Urban-Rural Demarcation (Thick Red Lines): Defines the urban and rural divide within the county.

Priority Funding Areas (Shaded Regions): Areas receiving targeted financial investments from local authorities.

Data Sources

OpenStreetMap for base layers.

Baltimore County Open Data Portal for property and zoning information.

Maryland GIS Repository for administrative boundaries and planning areas.

Tools & Software Used

QGIS: Open-source GIS software used for spatial analysis and visualization.

Shapefiles (.shp): Primary format for storing geospatial vector data.

GeoJSON (Optional): For web-friendly data visualization.

Purpose

This map serves as a tool for:
